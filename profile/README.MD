# Welcome!

This organization is full of my personal side projects.  I benefit from open source technology on a daily basis and it got me to where I am today so I wanted to do a bit of good myself.

Please note, I do not consider myself an expert in the devlopment realm by any means.  Please raise a PR if you spot mistakes or can make improvements.

I hope you find some of the items in here useful or they spark future projects of your own!
